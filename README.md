# Simple React Contacts

This tutorial shows how to use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to implement a web application for managing personal contacts. It uses the Carbon.io service [here](git@github.com:tfogo/example__simple-rest-api.git) as an API for managing the contacts.

## Installation

First we need to set up the API that our React app will be using. This application is built on top of the [Contact Service API](git@github.com:tfogo/example__simple-rest-api.git) example using Carbon.io. Set up that service first.

Then, clone and install dependencies for this application:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:tfogo/simple-react-contacts.git
$ npm install
```

## Running

To compile and serve the website, run:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

This should serve the website on `localhost:8080`.
